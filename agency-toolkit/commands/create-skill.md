# /create-skill

Scaffold a new standalone skill under `skills/` in the current repository.

**Arguments:** `$ARGUMENTS`

## Steps

1. **Parse arguments:**
   - First token: the skill name (kebab-case). If missing, ask.
   - Remaining tokens: optional one-line description seed.

2. **Validate the skill name:**
   - Must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$|^[a-z0-9]$`.
   - Must not already exist as a directory under `skills/`. If it does, stop and report.

3. **Draft a description:**
   - If a description seed was provided, expand it into a 2–4 sentence trigger description following the pattern: *"Use this skill when... Triggers on... Examples include..."*
   - If no seed, ask the user: "What should this skill do, and what user phrases or task types should trigger it?"

4. **Create the directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p skills/<name>/references
   mkdir -p skills/<name>/scripts
   ```

5. **Write `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`** with this template:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: <name>
   description: >
     <description>
   ---

   # <Title>

   <!-- Instructions for Claude go here. Use imperative form. -->
   <!-- Keep under 500 lines; move detailed content to references/ -->
   ```

6. **Write `skills/<name>/references/.gitkeep`** and **`skills/<name>/scripts/.gitkeep`** (empty files).

7. **Register in `marketplace.json`** if it exists at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:
   - Append a new entry to `plugins` array:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "<name>",
       "source": "./skills/<name>",
       "description": "<first sentence of description>",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "author": { "name": "<git user.name>" }
     }
     ```

8. **Update `skills/AGENTS.md`** — this repo's catalog of standalone, root-level skills (parallel to `plugins/AGENTS.md` for plugins and the top-level `agents/AGENTS.md` for standalone agent plugins). This only applies to skills scaffolded directly under this repo's `skills/`, not skills created inside a plugin's own `skills/` subdirectory.
   - If `skills/AGENTS.md` doesn't exist yet, create it:
     ```markdown
     # skills/

     Standalone skills available at repo root (not bundled inside a plugin).

     | Skill | Purpose | Primary triggers |
     |---|---|---|
     | `<name>` | <one-line purpose> | <2-3 short trigger phrases> |
     ```
   - If it exists, add one row for the new skill (or update the existing row if regenerating one).

9. **Confirm** to the user:
   ```
   Created skills/<name>/
   ├── SKILL.md
   ├── references/
   └── scripts/
   Registered in marketplace.json.
   Updated skills/AGENTS.md.
   Next: fill in the SKILL.md body, then run the plugin-validator agent to check the structure.
   ```

## Quality reminders (from Skill-Specification.md)

- `description` is the primary trigger signal — make it specific, with concrete example phrases.
- Body must be written in **imperative form** (instructions for Claude, not the user).
- Keep `SKILL.md` under **500 lines**; move depth to `references/`.
- No `model` field — model is set at session/project level.
